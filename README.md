I'm known for:
- Modding games such as Jump King
- Using code to find glitches in games for Speedrunners (Will be explained in a blog soon)
- Writing tools for games such as: autosplitters for speedrunners or replay data for racing game players

## Current Projects

### Jump King Speedrunning Mod (80%):

A C# Mod for the game Jump King which plugs the speedrunning timer capabilities of livesplit straight into the game. Keep track of Best times; Gold Splits; All Previous Runs and Segments and generates a Livesplit LSS file to be open outside of the game.

### Chameleon Twist Decompilation:

A C rebuild of the game Chameleon Twist for the Nintendo 64, similar to the mario 64 decomp project that was popular last year

### I also help add new features to the game Jump King as part of the JK+ Team:
