I'm known for:
- Modding games such as Jump King
- Using code to find glitches in games for Speedrunners (Will be explained in a blog soon)
- Writing tools for games such as: autosplitters for speedrunners or replay data for racing game players

## Current Projects

### Jump King Map Editor (27%):

A C# GUI that will be able to build custom modded levels for the game jump king as well as letting map makers easily edit enitity/player/object data. Currently maps are made in photoshop or sprite software and extra data needs to be edited in xmls by hand.

### Extreme3D (65%): 

Gathers memory data from the nintendo 64 game Extreme G and draws a 3d rendering of the player's race path using Blender. It also will be able to create a real time replay of the race using in-game models which will allow users better insight on their races than anything available in game

### I also help add new features to the game Jump King as part of the JK+ Team:
